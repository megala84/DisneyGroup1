Aurora, who is well known as a software professional works at Dreamhouse companty and she had an unique gift whenever she fell asleep her subconscious mind would dive deep into the world of code, visualizing bugs and diving in the logic of program to debug the issue. 

One day Aurora's teammates had to face a big issue that affected the production system and the bug was eventually raised with priority. The team members tried hard to investigate the issue but they couldnt understand the issue. The issue became very critical and that got escalated. Aurora thought to use her super power and she went into a slient meeting room and started to sleep. 

In her dream she found herself working on the bug, she analysed the code and debugged it. Finally she was able to crack the problem and suddenly she woke up and started to work on the change in her system. Her teammates gathered around her and everyone became so happy to see the bug was fixed.
