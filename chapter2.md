##story of sleeping beauty

Once upon a time, in a land of magic, there lived a beautiful princess named Aurora. She was known throughout the kingdom for her kindness, grace, and her heartwarming smile. Her hair was as golden as the sun, her eyes as blue as the sky, and her laughter as sweet as a songbird’s.
## Paragraph 3 and 4
Flora, with her red dress and magical wand, gave Aurora the gift of beauty. Fauna, in her green dress, gave her the gift of song. Merryweather, in her blue dress, wanted to give Aurora a gift too, but before she could finish, an evil sorceress named Maleficent appeared. Angry that she had not been invited to the celebration, she placed a curse on the young princess.

##paragraph 4
Maleficent declared that on Aurora’s sixteenth birthday, she would prick her finger on a spinning wheel’s spindle and fall into a deep sleep from which she could only be awakened by true love’s kiss. The kingdom was filled with sadness, and the good fairies were determined to protect the princess from the curse.
